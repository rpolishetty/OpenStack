# OpenStack Magnum Project
Intel Internship  
Rpolishetty

## 1. Introduction
> Magnum is an OpenStack API service developed by the OpenStack Containers Team making container orchestration engines such as Docker and Kubernetes available as first class resources in OpenStack. Magnum uses Heat to orchestrate an OS image which contains Docker and Kubernetes and runs that image in either virtual machines or bare metal in a cluster configuration.

The usage of containers is rapidly increasing across different fields. Docker is a popular tool that abstracts some aspects of Linux containers. Kubernetes and Swarm are popular tools to orchestrate nodes to run Docker containers. Containers on OpenStack enable denser and more flexible use of resources. Magnum brings containers up as first-class citizens on OpenStack by automating the orchestration of Kubernetes and Swarm clusters.

To accomplish this Magnum uses the standard OpenStack projects (Nova, Neutron, Glance, Cinder) and the Heat orchestration project. Essentially Magnum works at the Heat level to automate the specific use case of creating Kubernetes or Swarm clusters.

### 1.1. Purpose
Magnum provides an API designed to manage app containers. It differs from Nova, Docker, Swarm, or Kubernetes but leverages all as components. It also differs from Nova-Docker or using the Docker resource in Heat directly. Magnum makes Docker containers first-class citizens on OpenStack.

### 1.2. Terms

#### 1.2.1. General

**Container:** An instance of OS-level virtualization with an isolated user-space. Different from a virtual machine as it uses OS resources including the kernel and file system; not as isolated or secure. Different types of Linux containers exist. Magnum uses Docker containers.

**Docker:** A tool that automates and abstracts aspects of Linux containers. Uses features of the Linux kernel including cgroups, namespaces, and union-capable filesystems such as aufs.

**Kubernetes and Swarm:** Orchestration tools for the creation and management of clusters of nodes running Docker Engine. Swarm is developed by Docker and Kubernetes by Google.

**COE**: Container Orchestration Engine (Kubernetes, Swarm)

#### 1.2.2. Specific to Magnum

**Bay:** A collection of node objects where work is scheduled

**Bay Model:** An object stores template information about the bay which is used to create new bays consistently

#### 1.2.3. Specific to Kubernetes

**Pod:** A collection of containers running on one physical or virtual machine

**Service:** An abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them

**Replication Controller:** An abstraction for managing a group of pods to ensure a specified number of resources are running
Container: A Docker container

## 2. Architecture
![Magnum Architecture Diagram](./photos/magnum_architecture.png)

### 2.1. Components of Magnum
The Magnum project is composed of three main components: magnum-api, magnum-conductor, and python-magnumclient.

The python-magnumclient is similar to the other OpenStack Python clients. It sends requests to the magnum-api REST server. (The magnum-api REST server may run as one or more processes.) Upon receiving requests from clients, it communicates via AMQP to the magnum-conductor process. (Currently magnum-conductor is limited to a single process but is intended to scale in the future.)

### 2.2. OpenStack Components Used by Magnum
Magnum utilizes the typical OpenStack services: Nova, Neutron, Glance, Cinder and one less typical service: Heat.

Heat is an orchestration tool that allows for automating usage of the other OpenStack services. Magnum does not reinvent the wheel with orchestration, it adds another layer on top of Heat to further automate the creation of resources for container usage.

### 2.2. Detail of Communication Flow
Clients communicate requests to the magnum-api. The magnum-api then communicates requests to the magnum-conductor. The magnum-conductor interacts with Heat, Docker, and the COE.

For example a request to create a bay will hit the magnum-api first, which then communicates (via AMQP) with the magnum-conductor, which then uses a specified Heat Template and communicates with Heat (via API) to create the bay resource.

All subsequent requests to this bay (say to create a pod) will again pass from the magnum-api to the magnum-conductor and then to Docker or the COE.

## 3. Installation
**Note:** Assuming Ubuntu 14.04 and running Magnum on DevStack in a VM is not recommended at this time.

### 3.1. DevStack

#### 3.1.1. Setup Dev Environment

Add a *stack* user. Don't run services as root.
```
adduser stack
```

Since this user will be making many changes to your system, it will need to have sudo privileges:
```
apt-get install sudo -y
echo "stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
```

From here on you should use the user you created. Logout and login as that user or run:
```
su - stack
```

Install OS prerequisites, pip, and common pip prerequisites:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev \
                        libmysqlclient-dev libxslt-dev libpq-dev git \
                        libffi-dev gettext build-essential

curl -s https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python

sudo pip install virtualenv flake8 tox testrepository git-review
```

You may need to explicitly upgrade virtualenv to prevent tox errors:
```
sudo pip install -U virtualenv
```

Pull Magnum source code:
```
cd ~
git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/magnum
cd magnum
```

To run Magnum's entire test suite (optional, takes time, not required at install):
```
tox
```

To run a specific test, use a positional argument for the unit tests:
```
# run a specific test for Python 2.7
tox -epy27 -- test_conductor
```

You may pass options to the test programs using positional arguments:
```
# run all the Python 2.7 unit tests (in parallel!)
tox -epy27 -- --parallel
```

To run only the pep8/flake8 syntax and style checks:
```
tox -epep8
```

To run unit test coverage and check percentage of code covered:
```
tox -e cover
```

#### 3.1.2. Devstack

Devstack can be configured to enable magnum support. It is easy to develop magnum with the devstack environment. Magnum depends on nova, glance, heat and neutron to create and schedule virtual machines to simulate bare-metal (full bare-metal support is under active development).

NOTE: This guide installs Magnum using plugins, you can also install manually.
<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/magnum/dev/manual-devstack.html>

NOTE: Running devstack within a virtual machine with magnum enabled is not recommended at this time.

This session has only been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) and Fedora 20/21. We recommend users to select one of them if it is possible.

For in-depth guidance on adding magnum manually to a devstack instance, please refer to the <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/magnum/dev/dev-manual-devstack.html>

Clone devstack:
```
# Create a root directory for devstack if needed
sudo mkdir -p /opt/stack
sudo chown $USER /opt/stack

git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack /opt/stack/devstack
```
We will run devstack with minimal local.conf settings required to enable magnum, heat, and neutron (neutron is enabled by default in devstack since Kilo, and heat is enabled by the magnum plugin):
```
cat > /opt/stack/devstack/local.conf << END
[[local|localrc]]
DATABASE_PASSWORD=password
RABBIT_PASSWORD=password
SERVICE_TOKEN=password
SERVICE_PASSWORD=password
ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
# magnum requires the following to be set correctly
PUBLIC_INTERFACE=eth1
enable_plugin magnum https://git.openstack.org/openstack/magnum
# Enable barbican service and use it to store TLS certificates
# For details http://docs.openstack.org/developer/magnum/dev/dev-tls.html
enable_plugin barbican https://git.openstack.org/openstack/barbican
VOLUME_BACKING_FILE_SIZE=20G
END
```
**NOTE:** Update PUBLIC_INTERFACE as appropriate for your system.

Optionally, you can enable ceilometer in devstack. If ceilometer is enabled, magnum will periodically send metrics to ceilometer:
```
cat >> /opt/stack/devstack/local.conf << END
enable_plugin ceilometer https://git.openstack.org/openstack/ceilometer
END
```
More devstack configuration information can be found at
<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/configuration.html>

More neutron configuration information can be found at
<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/guides/neutron.html>

Run devstack:
```
cd /opt/stack/devstack
./stack.sh
```
**NOTE:** This will take a little extra time when the Fedora Atomic micro-OS image is downloaded for the first time.

At this point, two magnum process (magnum-api and magnum-conductor) will be running on devstack screens. If you make some code changes and want to test their effects, just stop and restart magnum-api and/or magnum-conductor.

Prepare your session to be able to use the various openstack clients including magnum, neutron, and glance. Create a new shell, and source the devstack openrc script:
```
source /opt/stack/devstack/openrc admin admin
```
Magnum has been tested with the Fedora Atomic micro-OS and CoreOS. Magnum will likely work with other micro-OS platforms, but each requires individual support in the heat template.

The Fedora Atomic micro-OS image will automatically be added to glance. You can add additional images manually through glance. To verify the image created when installing devstack use:
```
glance -v image-list

+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------+-------------+------------------+-----------+--------+

```

To list the available commands and resources for magnum, use:
```
magnum help
```

To list out the health of the internal services, namely conductor, of magnum, use:
```
magnum service-list

+----+------------------------------------+------------------+-------+
| id | host                               | binary           | state |

```

### 3.2. Service by Service / Production
Magnum does not currently have documentation on how to install it "service by service" or in a production setup. Usage is still centered around developing using DevStack. There seems to be some movement to create a guide but there isn't a formal blueprint or progress being made on it. There's discussion of it below.
<https://openstack.nimeyo.com/62358/openstack-operators-how-to-install-magnum?start=0#a_list_title>

## 4. CLI
Magnum is used through the *magnum* Python client. To interact with bays (create pods, run containers, etc.) you use the magnum client, not the kubectl or docker-swarm clients. Here's a partial overview of the available commands.

```

### 4.1. Creating a Kubernetes Bay

Create a keypair for use with the baymodel:

```
test -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub || ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
nova keypair-add --pub-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub testkey
```

Create a baymodel. This is similar in nature to a flavor and describes to magnum how to construct the bay. The coe (Container Orchestration Engine) and keypair need to be specified for the baymodel:

```
magnum baymodel-create --name k8sbaymodel \
  --image-id fedora-21-atomic-5 \
  --keypair-id testkey \
  --external-network-id public \
  --dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8 \
  --flavor-id m1.small \
  --docker-volume-size 5 \
  --network-driver flannel \
  --coe kubernetes
```

Create a bay. Use the baymodel name as a template for bay creation. This bay will result in one master kubernetes node and one minion node:

```
magnum bay-create --name k8sbay --baymodel k8sbaymodel --node-count 1
```

Bays will have an initial status of CREATE_IN_PROGRESS. Magnum will update the status to CREATE_COMPLETE when it is done creating the bay. Do not create containers, pods, services, or replication controllers before magnum finishes creating the bay. They will likely not be created, and may cause magnum to become confused.

The existing bays can be listed as follows:

```
magnum bay-list

+--------------------------------------+---------+------------+-----------------+
| uuid                                 | name    | node_count | status          |
+--------------------------------------+---------+------------+-----------------+
| 9dccb1e6-02dc-4e2b-b897-10656c5339ce | k8sbay  | 1          | CREATE_COMPLETE |
+--------------------------------------+---------+------------+-----------------+
```

More detailed information for a given bay is obtained via:

```
magnum bay-show k8sbay
```

After a bay is created, you can dynamically add/remove node(s) to/from the bay by updating the node_count attribute. For example, to add one more node:

```
magnum bay-update k8sbay replace node_count=2
```

Bays in the process of updating will have a status of UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS. Magnum will update the status to UPDATE_COMPLETE when it is done updating the bay.

NOTE: Reducing node_count will remove all the existing pods on the nodes that are deleted. If you choose to reduce the node_count, magnum will first try to remove empty nodes with no pods running on them. If you reduce node_count by more than the number of empty nodes, magnum must remove nodes that have running pods on them. This action will delete those pods. We strongly recommend using a replication controller before reducing the node_count so any removed pods can be automatically recovered on your remaining nodes.

Heat can be used to see detailed information on the status of a stack or specific bay:

To check the list of all bay stacks:

```
heat stack-list
```

To check an individual bay’s stack:

```
heat stack-show <stack-name or stack_id>
```

Monitoring bay status in detail (e.g., creating, updating):

```
BAY_HEAT_NAME=$(heat stack-list | awk "/\sk8sbay-/{print \$4}")
echo ${BAY_HEAT_NAME}
heat resource-list ${BAY_HEAT_NAME}
```

### 4.2. Using Kubernetes Bay

NOTE: For the following examples, only one minion node is required in the k8s bay created previously.

Kubernetes provides a number of examples you can use to check that things are working. You may need to clone kubernetes using:

```
wget https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/download/v1.0.1/kubernetes.tar.gz
tar -xvzf kubernetes.tar.gz
```

NOTE: We do not need to install Kubernetes, we just need the example file from the tarball.

Here’s how to set up the replicated redis example. First, create a pod for the redis-master:

```
cd kubernetes/examples/redis
magnum pod-create --manifest ./redis-master.yaml --bay k8sbay
```

Now create a service to provide a discoverable endpoint for the redis sentinels in the cluster:

```
magnum coe-service-create --manifest ./redis-sentinel-service.yaml --bay k8sbay
```

To make it a replicated redis cluster create replication controllers for the redis slaves and sentinels:

```
sed -i 's/\(replicas: \)1/\1 2/' redis-controller.yaml
magnum rc-create --manifest ./redis-controller.yaml --bay k8sbay

sed -i 's/\(replicas: \)1/\1 2/' redis-sentinel-controller.yaml
magnum rc-create --manifest ./redis-sentinel-controller.yaml --bay k8sbay
```

Full lifecycle and introspection operations for each object are supported. For example, magnum bay-create, magnum baymodel-delete, magnum rc-show, magnum coe-service-list.

Now there are four redis instances (one master and three slaves) running across the bay, replicating data between one another.

Run the bay-show command to get the IP of the bay host on which the redis-master is running:

```
magnum bay-show k8sbay

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

| node_addresses     | [u'192.168.19.86']                                         |
| master_count       | 1                                                          |

| name               | k8sbay                                                     |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The output here indicates the redis-master is running on the bay host with IP address 192.168.19.86. To access the redis master:

```
ssh minion@192.168.19.86
REDIS_ID=$(sudo docker ps | grep redis:v1 | grep k8s_master | awk '{print $1}')
sudo docker exec -i -t $REDIS_ID redis-cli

127.0.0.1:6379> set replication:test true
OK
^D

exit  # Log out of the host
```

Log into one of the other container hosts and access a redis slave from it. You can use nova list to enumerate the kube-minions. For this example we will use the same host as above:

```
ssh minion@192.168.19.86
REDIS_ID=$(sudo docker ps | grep redis:v1 | grep k8s_redis | awk '{print $1}')
sudo docker exec -i -t $REDIS_ID redis-cli

127.0.0.1:6379> get replication:test
"true"
^D

exit  # Log out of the host
```

Additional useful commands from a given minion:

```
sudo docker ps  # View Docker containers on this minion
kubectl get po  # Get pods
kubectl get rc  # Get replication controllers
kubectl get svc  # Get services
kubectl get nodes  # Get nodes
```

After you finish using the bay, you want to delete it. A bay can be deleted as follows:

```
magnum bay-delete k8sbay
```

  8. Progress
    - I've done this in a handful changes.
    - 6 change proposals so far.
    - https://review.openstack.org/#/q/project:openstack/magnum+branch:master+topic:bug/1561232
    - 4 merged, 1 abandoned, 1 awaiting review.
    - One was abandoned because it was for the Devstack plugin and since Devstack requires bash, it didn't matter.
    - There are 3 more files that need to be fixed but they're more involved than simple syntax correction.
    - These 3 write configuration to /etc/bashrc.
    - Need to figure out a different place for these variables, possibly /etc/profile.
    - /etc/profile doesn't get run for non-login sessions though, so this may not work.
