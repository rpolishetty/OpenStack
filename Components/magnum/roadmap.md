# Project Roadmap

## For Wednesday Meetings
- 3-30-16:
  - focused on installation section
  - polish up sections from last week
  - need to go through and document install using DevStack
    - (NOTE: Running devstack within a virtual machine with magnum enabled is not recommended at this time.)
    - Annie and Shawn working on this
  - we're meeting Tuesday's and Thursday's from 2-3 PM every week
  - let's meet next Monday from 2-3 just next week
  - make sure to make talking points / informal script when we meet on Tuesday for the presentation
  - *talked to Paul, no longer need these*
    - Service by Service
      - https://openstack.nimeyo.com/62358/openstack-operators-how-to-install-magnum?start=10#a_list_title
      - both going to chip away at this, discuss progress, post links in here
    - OpenStack Ansible
      - this relies on how far we get with a manual "production" install
